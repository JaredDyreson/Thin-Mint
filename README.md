# Foreword

These scripts are more of a basic outline of how my machine actually operates and what my development environment actually looks like. This was the last part of the puzzle in my back up solution methodology which you can find [right here](https://github.com/JaredDyreson/mintyrice/docs/backup-solution.md). Also, the title is a little misleading as these scripts were built on top of a bare Arch Linux installation. I was trying to replicate as closely a I could all of my favorite aspects of Linux Mint and combine it with the efficiency of Arch. The migration has yet to happen because I don't want to squander the perfectly good installation I have already. That was not the point of this repository. I also treated this as an unexpected learning experience in which I got my hands dirty in the Linux command line more than I ever have. Installing Arch Linux fits into this Linux paradigm, in it being a right of passage. Now, after wanting to pull my hair out on several occasions, I now have created an easy to understand, **well** documented installation guide. Please, if you have any critiques, please make a pull request and I will make sure it is addressed. Also, as cliche as it is, the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) is your friend.
